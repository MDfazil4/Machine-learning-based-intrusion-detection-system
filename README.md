# **Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**

## **Project Overview**

This project is a Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to detect potential security threats in network traffic using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The system employs LSTM for time-series-based anomaly detection, capturing patterns in network traffic data over time. Additionally, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to interpret the modelâ€™s predictions and provide insights into which features contribute to the detection of intrusions.
